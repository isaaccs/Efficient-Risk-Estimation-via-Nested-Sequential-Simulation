# Efficient-Risk-Estimation-via-Nested-Sequential-Simulation

As part of my Master at UPMC, I worked in partnership with Jérôme Ramassamy on the article "Efficient Risk Estimation via Nested Sequential Simulation" of Broadie, Du and Moallemi.

The objective of the project was to understand, explain, code and retrieve the results of the methods proposed in the article.
